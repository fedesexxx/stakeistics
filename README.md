Stakeistics is a visualizer for stake.com json files based in python and displayed in graphics.

I finally know how to use github, see releases for, like... the releases.

Libraries needed for it to run:
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-pathlib

Use:
1. Create a folder
2. Place the script and the json files there

4. thats like all of it, it is really that simple
   
How does it looks?
